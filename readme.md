# Lovecraft Story Analysis

This project analyzes the word count and sentiment of **H.P. Lovecraft's** stories to explore potential correlations between story length and emotional tone.

## **Project Overview**

- **Sentiment Score** (negative to positive)

## **Analysis Approach**

1. **Word Count Distribution**: Visualized with a histogram showing the spread of word counts, with an average indicated.
2. **Sentiment Score Distribution**: Uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to visualize the sentiment across stories.
3. **Sentiment vs. Word Count**: A scatter plot explores any relationship between story length and sentiment.
